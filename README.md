# Storz & Bickel Volcano Hybrid Integration for Home Assistant

A custom **Home Assistant integration** to connect and control the **Storz & Bickel Volcano Hybrid Vaporizer** via **Bluetooth**. This integration enables precise control over the vaporizer's heat and pump functions, real-time monitoring of temperature, and seamless automation into the Home Assistant scripting and automation systems.

This is a fork of [Chuffnugget/volcano_integration](https://github.com/Chuffnugget/volcano_integration) (v3.2.4), maintained with bug fixes.

One of the main features of the official Volcano app includes workflows; these are the real-time Bluetooth instructions usually sent from your mobile device to the vaporizer when using it. But, because these instructions are sent in real-time, it means that closing or sometimes even minimizing the app actually stops the workflow prematurely. This integration fixes that by using Home Assistant as the Bluetooth client instead of your mobile device; the connection is persistent and asynchronous. This allows us to utilize Home Assistant scripts and automations in the same way we would create a workflow.

The default workflow in the official app is as follows:

```
- Turn heat on.
- Set temperature to 170C.
- Wait until temperature reaches target.
- Turn on pump for 5 seconds.
- Set heat to 175C.
- Wait until temperature reaches target.
- Turn on pump for 5 seconds. Set heat to 180C.
- Wait until temperature reaches target. Turn on pump for 5 seconds.
- Repeats until temperature reaches 200C.
```

To translate this into a Home Assistant script:

```yaml
alias: Volcano Workflow 1
sequence:
  - action: volcano_integration.connect
    data:
      wait_until_connected: true
  - action: volcano_integration.heat_on
    data: {}
  - action: volcano_integration.set_temperature
    data:
      temperature: 170
      wait_until_reached: true
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_on
    data: {}
  - delay:
      seconds: 5
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_off
    data: {}
  - action: volcano_integration.set_temperature
    data:
      temperature: 175
      wait_until_reached: true
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_on
    data: {}
  - delay:
      seconds: 5
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_off
    data: {}
  - action: volcano_integration.set_temperature
    data:
      temperature: 180
      wait_until_reached: true
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_on
    data: {}
  - delay:
      seconds: 5
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_off
    data: {}
  - action: volcano_integration.set_temperature
    data:
      temperature: 185
      wait_until_reached: true
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_on
    data: {}
  - delay:
      seconds: 5
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_off
    data: {}
  - action: volcano_integration.set_temperature
    data:
      temperature: 190
      wait_until_reached: true
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_on
    data: {}
  - delay:
      seconds: 5
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_off
    data: {}
  - action: volcano_integration.set_temperature
    data:
      temperature: 195
      wait_until_reached: true
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_on
    data: {}
  - delay:
      seconds: 5
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_off
    data: {}
  - action: volcano_integration.set_temperature
    data:
      temperature: 200
      wait_until_reached: true
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_on
    data: {}
  - delay:
      seconds: 5
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_off
    data: {}
  - action: volcano_integration.heat_off
    data: {}
description: "A full workflow from 170C to 200C, with 5 second pumps between every 5C."
mode: restart
```

I also strongly recommend creating another script, which allows you to stop any Volcano workflow at will. It should also turn the heat and pump off:

```yaml
alias: Volcano Stop All Scripts
sequence:
  - action: volcano_integration.heat_off
  - action: volcano_integration.pump_off
  - action: script.turn_off
    target:
      entity_id:
        - script.volcano_workflow_1
description: "Stops all Volcano scripts and turns off the heat/pump."
mode: restart
```

Now you're set to create your own scripts and automations for the Volcano Vaporizer.

⚠️ WARNING: For safety reasons, do not leave your Volcano Vaporizer running while unattended. This is an experimental integration, subject to changes in functionality at any time, and should not be considered reliable. The Volcano poses a fire hazard and must be used with caution.

## Troubleshooting

- **Bluetooth Adapter**  
  Ensure your system recognizes and can use the Bluetooth adapter. If the adapter isn't detected, the integration won't be able to connect.

- **Proximity**  
  Keep the Volcano within a reasonable range of the Bluetooth adapter to prevent connectivity issues.

- **Logs**  
  Check Home Assistant's logs for debug messages. Increasing the log level for `custom_components.volcano_integration` can help diagnose connection problems.
